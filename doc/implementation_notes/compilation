Phases of compilation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Lex & Parse
    - Handled by Antlr
    - Creates a parse tree
    
- Compile
    - Walks the parse tree and creates our Python class objects
    - As types/parameters/etc are defined, a namespace stack is maintained
    - identifiers are always resolved immediately
        - If an id token is not within any available namespace, then throw an error immediately
    - Instance tree is created
    - All expressions are left unresolved
        - Class representation of the expression is kept so that any parameters
          in it can be fully resolved later.
    - Dynamic property assignments replace property expressions as they are seen.

          
- Elaborate
    In the following order:
    - User specifies a single top-level component from root
        - Specifies any parameters where applicable
    
    - All expressions are resolved to their resulting values
        - Parameters
        - Properties
        - Instance addressing expressions
        - Instance array sizes
        
    - User-specified default properties are propagated
    - Propagate addressing mode rules
    - Resolve item addresses
    
    - Component type names are uniquified according to RDL rules in section 5.1.1.4
    
- Validate
    Perform structural validation checks
