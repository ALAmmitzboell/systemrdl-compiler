SystemRDL spec issues
================================================================================
Semantic rule 10.6.1.c is violated in 5.1.2.2.2-Example 2
    reg 'a' has an implied regwidth of 32
    reg 'a' gets assigned an accesswidth of 64 via default
    accesswidth > regwidth!
    
    Resolution:
        Rule 10.6.1.c seems unnecessary. Waiving checks for it.
